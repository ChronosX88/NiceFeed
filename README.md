# NiceFeed
RSS Reader for Android: a personal project while learning Kotlin, mainly something for me to use. RSS is an old technology and there are already many readers out there, but I find many of them clunky, hard to navigate, and jam-packed with features I don't need. The aim here is a nimble but fully functional app with good architecture and not too many frills. Stay tuned for releases.
