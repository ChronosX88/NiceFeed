# NiceFeed
NiceFeed is an RSS Reader for Android. This started out as a personal project while learning Kotlin. RSS is an old technology and there are already many readers out there, but I find many of them hard to navigate and jam-packed with features I don't need. The aim is an attractive and intuitive app, leightweight but fully functional with not too many frills.

<h3>Early Access</h3>
NiceFeed is now in Beta and available on Google Play. It is also now available on IzzyOnDroid for non-Play Store users. Please note that until a stable release, some functionality may still be limited. I'm constantly updating this app and trying to make it better. I would truly appreciate any and all feedback, especially if you find any issues or bugs, or have ideas for new features (please open an issue). I also welcome contributions.<br>
