<p><i>NiceFeed</i> is an RSS Reader for Android. I wanted something to help me keep up with the news while learning Kotlin at the same time. RSS is an old technology and there are already many readers out there, but I find many of them clunky, hard to navigate, and jam-packed with features I don't need. The aim is an attractive and intuitive app, leightweight but fully functional with not too many frills.</p>
<p>I would truly appreciate any and all feedback, especially if you find any issues or bugs, or have ideas for new features. I am also open to contributions.</p>
